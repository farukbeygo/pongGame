# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong, built with Python and the Turtle graphics library.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you will need to have Python 3 and the Turtle library installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Turtle by typing `pip install turtle` in your terminal or command prompt.

Once you have Python and Turtle installed, you can run the game by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the game files are located, and typing `python main.py`. This will launch the game window.

## How to Play

The game is a two-player game, with each player controlling a paddle on either side of the screen. The goal is to hit the ball back and forth without letting it pass your paddle. If the ball hits the opponent's side of the screen, you score a point. The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.

Player 1 controls the right paddle using the up and down arrow keys, while player 2 controls the left paddle using the `W` and `S` keys.
